This Code is part of my matura project. In this project I got to know how neural networks function.
Furthermore I optimizied a neural Network and I implemented it into a small application.
The application is a small game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors". 
The computer tries to recognize the opponents hand with the help of a neural network to then be able to defeat him everytime.

The Python Code that I use in this project is partially based on the book nnfs.io with the following copyright:
